**[Alexey Ivakhnenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Ivakhnenko)**

Born on 30 March 1913 in Kobelyaki near Poltava in the east Ukraine.

Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Professor. Doctor of Technical sciences. Advisor of the Directorate of our International Centre. Distinguished scientist of Ukraine.

A.G. Ivakhnenko is an outstanding scientist in the field of automatic control, cybernetics and informatics, whose scientific results have received a worldwide recognition. He published about 45 monographs and more than 400 scientific articles, many of which, and first of all books, have been translated in English, German, Polish, Bulgarian, Romanian and Chinese languages. The significant quantity of his articles has been published in scientific periodicals of USA, England, Germany, and other countries.

The scientific school of A.G.Ivakhnenko for a long time serves as an authoritative and productive smithy of highly skilled scientific staff: under his supervision 220 candidate (Ph.D) dissertations were carried out and successfully defended, and almost 27 of his pupils have defended doctor dissertations and created their own scientific schools.

Alexey has developed new principles and devices for automatic control of speed of electric engines and for computing of systems with magnetic amplifiers. His achievements in the invariance theory and in the theory of combined systems of automatic control working by the principle of compensation of measured disturbances are universally recognized. He has written the first domestic monograph on technical cybernetics which was republished abroad several times. The further development of principles of combined control in A.G. Ivakhnenkoâ€™s works is connected with the use of principles, devices and ways of self-tuning, self-training, pattern recognition and forecasting in control systems.

In last 35 years, the main brainchild of A.G. Ivakhnenko, the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), is actively developing as a method of inductive modelling and forecasting of complex processes and systems. In 1984, in USA the collective monograph of American and Japanese scientists with the delineation and examples of effective application of GMDH in various applied areas was published. Dozens of publications on the subject of GMDH appear each year in scientific magazines of the world and on the websites in Internet. In May 2002 in Lviv (Ukraine) the I International conference on inductive modelling ICIM'2002 has been held, devoted to theoretical and applied issues of GMDH, where scientists from many countries of the world have participated.

Graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Electric Engineering in 1938. In 1943 he became a candidate in electrical sciences at the Physics Institute of Moscow University, and in 1944 he joined the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kyiv. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on invariance theory in 1953. In 1944 he joined the Polytechnic Institute of Kyiv, first as Lecturer, later as Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Since 1964 was Head of the Combined Control Systems Division of the Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraina. He was chief editor of the journal Avtomatika. Have 5 children, 8 grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren.

A.G. Ivakhnenko carries a rank of the Distinguished man of science of Ukraine, is awarded with an "Friendship of the nations" order and medals. In 1991 has received as one of the authors the State premium of Ukraine for works in the field of the theory of invariance of automatic systems. In 1997 with a group of scientists he has received the State premium of Ukraine for the series of works on information technologies in the field of artificial intelligence.

Alexey Ivakhnenko was an example of scientist with a heightened sense of novelty and outstanding scientific intuition. Nowadays he continues to work actively, lavishly generating original scientific ideas and important results.

Alexey Ivakhnenko has died in October 16, 2007 in the age of 94 years.

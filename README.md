Group Method of Data Handling was applied in a great variety of areas for deep learning and knowledge discovery, forecasting and data mining, optimization, and pattern recognition.
Inductive GMDH algorithms give the possibility to find automatically interrelations in data, to select an optimal structure of a model or network, and to increase the accuracy of existing algorithms.

This original self-organizing approach is different from the deductive methods used for modeling. It has an inductive nature - it finds the best solution by sorting out possible variants.

External Criterion Characteristic By sorting different solutions GMDH networks aim to minimize the influence of the author on the results of modeling. The computer itself finds the structure of the optimal model or laws that act in a system.

Group Method of Data Handling is a set of several algorithms for different problem solutions. It consists of parametric, clusterization, analogues complexing, rebinarization, and probability algorithms.

This inductive approach is based on sorting gradually complicated models and selecting the optimal solution by a minimum of external criterion characteristics. Not only polynomials but also non-linear, probabilistic functions or clusterizations are used as basic models.

GMDH approach can be useful because:

* The optimal complexity of the model structure is found, adequate for the level of noise in the data sample. For real problems, with noised or short data, simplified optimal models are more accurate.
* The number of layers and neurons in hidden layers, model structure, and other optimal hyperparameters are determined automatically.
* It guarantees that the most accurate or unbiased models will be found - the method doesn't miss the best solution during sorting of all variants (in the given class of functions).
* As input variables can be used non-linear functions or features, may influence output variables.
* It automatically finds interpretable relationships in data and selects effective input variables.
* GMDH sorting algorithms are rather simple for software development.
* Twice-multilayered neural nets can be used to increase the accuracy of other modeling algorithms.
* The method gets information directly from the data sample and minimizes the influence of apriori author assumptions about the results of modeling.
* The approach gives the possibility to find the objective physical model of the object (law or segmentation) - the same in future samples. 

It was implemented in many commercial software tools.
Also, GMDH is known well as Polynomial Neural Networks, Abductive and Statistical Learning Networks.

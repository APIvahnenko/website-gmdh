# Applications

Besides the applications of commercial GMDH software since 1967 there were a lot of applications of GMDH in very different fields. Many of them are described in the ukrainian journal "Avtomatica" (translated in "Soviet Automatic Control", "Soviet Journal of Automation and Information Sciences" and then in "Journal of Automation and Information Sciences" in full size). Some examples with descriptions are also given at Script Software [site](http://www.knowledgeminer.net/solution.htm). The basic GMDH technique applications include the studies on:

    - The correlation models were used for predicting weather in movable coordinates (to take winds into account);
    - The ecological variables were used in combined system of weather-climate equations to increase prediction accuracy and lead time;
    - The method of group analogues was used for long-range predictions. it is based on analogues complexing algorithm or on objective clustering of the weather into number of clusters; the set of significant variables was set up objectively by the OSA algorithm;
